Make notes or set reminders for yourself.
## Description
Want to make a personal reminder for yourself? Or do you want to take important notes relating to your business? Use this application!
### Why did I make this?
I wanted to make a more convenient way for people to make notes and reminders for important events in thier personal and professional lives.
### What problem does this solve?
In the decades past, people would use sticky notes to make reminders for themselves, be it personal things or business things. Nowadays, in the age where technology is quickly evolving faster than ever, people will want to use a computer or mobile phone app that lets them take notes in the event that they don't have any paper or any pens to write notes down.
### What did I learn?
Here's some things I learned while working on this.
1. I learned about the different web request methods and how they work in the world of web development.
2. I learned how to link webpages to each other by using express.js.
3. I also learned how to set up localhosts and use them as PORTs.
